### Team member work

#### Peeter
- **What I did:**
I worked on an Issue to create PR/Issue templates to standardize them and to reduce boilerplate in them. 
- **Merge strategies and why**
I used basic merge, didn't think it was necessary to squash my commits because I separated PR and Issue template commits.
- **Problems**
Didn't encounter any problems in the workflow
