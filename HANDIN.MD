### Team member work

#### Peeter
- **What I did:**
I worked on an Issue to create PR/Issue templates to standardize them and to reduce boilerplate in them. 
- **Merge strategies and why**
I used basic merge, didn't think it was necessary to squash my commits because I separated PR and Issue template commits.
- **Problems**
Didn't encounter any problems in the workflow

#### Robert
- **What I did:**
I created a Definition of Done, describing when a given task may be considered completed, and a team workflow section in the TEAM.MD file.
Also worked on an isuue to create a proper error message when entering duplicate category name in Inventori page.
- **Merge strategies and why**
Used basic merge, this preserves the full context of the pull request.
- **Problems**
Didn't encounter any serious problems
